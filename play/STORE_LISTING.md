## App name (30 chars max)

ThermalTrace

## Short description (80 chars max)

Monitor probe temperatures and freeze alerts from your ThermalTrace account.

## Full description

ThermalTrace is the Android companion for thermaltrace.dev. Sign in with your existing account to view live probe readings, history, alerts, devices, and household settings — the same data as the web dashboard.

The phone does not collect temperature itself. Sensors stay on your ESP/home hardware; this app talks to ThermalTrace over HTTPS.

Features:
• Live home readings with space filters and auto-refresh
• History sparklines (24h / 7d / 30d)
• Alert inbox, acknowledge, and threshold settings
• Device rename and space assignment
• Household members and invites
• Optional push notifications (Pro) via Firebase Cloud Messaging

Account required. Create or manage your account at https://thermaltrace.dev

Delete your account anytime: sign in on the web → Dashboard → Settings → Delete account.

## News / COVID / finance

None of the special categories apply.

## Ads

No ads.

## In-app purchases / subscriptions
